# Pigweed Experimental

[TOC]

This repository contains experimental pigweed modules.

## Repository setup

Clone this repo with `--recursive` to get all required submodules.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://pigweed.googlesource.com/pigweed/experimental
```

This will pull the [Pigweed source
repository](https://pigweed.googlesource.com/pigweed/pigweed) into
`third_party/pigweed`. If you already cloned but forgot to `--recursive` run
`git submodule update --init` to pull all submodules.
